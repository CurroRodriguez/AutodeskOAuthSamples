 These samples use the stagging Oxygen server to demo the '3 legs' process to authentify
 a user on the Autodesk Cloud infrastructure.
 
 AdskOAuthWebNoExtension.php uses cURL and the Google framework.
 
 The '3 legs' process is as follow:
 a- Get a 'request token' from the system
 b- Authorize the received token. Note here that Autodesk currently require you to manual log on Oxygen
      for authorization. This is why the sample is using your default browser for logging.
 c- Get an 'access token' and a session
 
 The sample also does not do a log-out at the end in order to save and reuse the token in other WEB sessions
 Instead it tries to save it in a file. But you can choose to save the token another way.
